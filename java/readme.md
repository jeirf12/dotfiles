# Java Configuration

## Execution ðŸ”§

### Steps to compile and run :eye_speech_bubble:
First we open a console and compile the file with this command:
```
 $ javac choosefile.java
```
If there are several files that you have to compile, for example in the `minimumCoatingAlgorithm` folder, the following is executed:
```
 $ javac *.java
```
when you did the above commands, run the main file with `java nameClassMain.java`, in this case look for the file that contains it. files without a folder are usually their own main.

note: In case you want to execute the minimum cover algorithms, enter the `Test.java` class and modify the file uncommenting the method and use it separately, uncomment one and the other commented ones.

#### Optional
Inside the `minimumCoatingAlgorithm` folder there is a `Makefile` file and you can use the following commands.

To compile:
```
 $ make 
```
To execute:
```
 $ make run
```
To clean up the workspace with compiles:
```
 $ make clean
```
